/*
Given a string str of length n, find if the string is K-Palindrome or not. A k-palindrome string transforms into a palindrome on removing at most k characters from it.


Example 1:

Input: str = "abcdecba"
n = 8, k = 1
Output: 1
Explaination: By removing 'd' or 'e' 
we can make it a palindrome.

Example 2:

Input: str = "abcdefcba"
n = 9, k = 1
Output: 0
Explaination: By removing a single 
character we cannot make it a palindrome.
